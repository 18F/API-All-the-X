EPA,https://edg.epa.gov,R2 & NE: State Level 2006-2010 ACS Housing Summary,"The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. States and equivalent entities are the primary governmental divisions of the United States. In addition to the fifty States, the Census Bureau treats the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and each of the Island Areas (American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) as the statistical equivalents of States for the purpose of data presentation.<br /><br /> / This table contains housing data, including building age, value and/or rent, length of occupation, number of units, home heating type, and number of vehicles from the American Community Survey 2006-2010 database for states. The American Community Survey (ACS) is a household survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that currently has an annual sample size of about 3.5 million addresses. ACS estimates provides communities with the current information they need to plan investments and services. Information from the survey generates estimates that help determine how more than $400 billion in federal and state funds are distributed annually. Each year the survey produces data that cover the periods of 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimates for geographic areas in the United States and Puerto Rico, ranging from neighborhoods to Congressional districts to the entire nation. / This table also has a companion table (Same table name with MOE Suffix) with the margin of error (MOE) values for each estimated element. MOE is expressed as a measure value for each estimated element. So a value of 25 and an MOE of 5 means 25 +/- 5 (or statistical certainty between 20 and 30). There are also special cases of MOE. An MOE of -1 means the associated estimates do not have a measured error. An MOE of 0 means that error calculation is not appropriate for the associated value. An MOE of 109 is set whenever an estimate value is 0. / The MOEs of aggregated elements and percentages must be calculated. This process means using standard error calculations as described in ""American Community Survey Multiyear Accuracy of the Data (3-year 2008-2010 and 5-year 2006-2010)"". Also, following Census guidelines, aggregated MOEs do not use more than 1 0-element MOE (109) to prevent over estimation of the error. Due to the complexity of the calculations, some percentage MOEs cannot be calculated (these are set to null in the summary-level MOE tables).",{FC109CD7-8227-4E15-9CC1-E76E8A0AB0D5},public

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas. Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census. A block may consist of one or more faces.",{077F1AB9-0D56-4D98-BEE1-DA24B96C172E},public

EPA,ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/az/az_eco_l4.zip,Level IV Ecoregions of Arizona,"Ecoregions by state were extracted from the seamless national shapefile. Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989). / Literature cited: / Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997, Ecological regions of North America- toward a common perspective: Montreal, Commission for Environmental Cooperation, 71 p. / Gallant, A.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas.

The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989). / Literature cited: / Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997, Ecological regions of North America- toward a common perspective: Montreal, Commission for Environmental Cooperation, 71 p. / Gallant, A.

There are many limitations to the data so it is advised that these metadata be read carefully before use. Although the records for these grant locations are drawn directly from the official EPA grants repository (IGMS •À_?? Integrated Grants Management System), it is important to know that the IGMS was designed for purposes that did not include accurately portraying the grant•À_??s place of performance on a map. Instead, the IGMS grant recipient•À_??s mailing address is the primary source for grant locations. Particularly for statewide grants that are administered via State and Regional headquarters, the grant location data should not be interpreted as the grant•À_??s place of performance. In 2012, a policy was established to start to collect the place of performance as a pilot for newly awarded grants •À_?? that were deemed •À_??community-based•À_?? in nature and for these the grant location depicted in this database will be a more reliable indicator of the actual place of performance. As for the locational accuracy of these points, there is no programmatic certification process, however, they are being entered by the Grant Project Officers who are most familiar with the details of the grants, apart from the grantees themselves. Limitations notwithstanding, this is a first-of-breed attempt to map all of the Agency•À_??s grants, using the best internal geocoding algorithms available, and is a useful tool for getting to an understanding of the distribution of USEPA grant-giving. / Apart from the ""community-based"" grants that have been targeted for update with actual place of performance information, this dataset is improved on a regular basis with updates for the place of performance for Brownfields and related grant programs with a nightly refresh with the ACRES database (http://www.epa.gov/brownfields/pubs/acres/).",{169C612D-2489-4CC9-9851-75D07190B057},non-public

The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997).

The consequences of these interactions show that land use may exacerbate or alleviate climate change effects. Based on these findings it is important to use land-use scenarios that are consistent with the specific assumptions underlying climate-change scenarios. The Integrated Climate and Land-Use Scenarios (ICLUS) project developed land-use outputs that are based on a downscaled version of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) social, economic, and demographic storylines. ICLUS outputs are derived from a pair of models. A demographic model generates county-level population estimates that are distributed by a spatial allocation model (SERGoM v3) as housing density across the landscape. Land-use outputs were developed for the four main SRES storylines and a baseline (""base case""). The model is run for the conterminous USA and output is available for each scenario by decade to 2100. In addition to housing density at a 1 hectare spatial resolution, this project also generated estimates of impervious surface at a resolution of 1 square kilometer. This shapefile holds population data for all counties of the conterminous USA for all decades (2010-2100) and SRES population growth scenarios (A1, A2, B1, B2), as well as a 'base case' (BC) scenario, for use in the Integrated Climate and Land Use Scenarios (ICLUS) project.",{1BB3ECBD-3EEB-43F3-AF78-B1196ACCC732},public

The consequences of these interactions show that land use may exacerbate or alleviate climate change effects. Based on these findings it is important to use land-use scenarios that are consistent with the specific assumptions underlying climate-change scenarios. The Integrated Climate and Land-Use Scenarios (ICLUS) project developed land-use outputs that are based on a downscaled version of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) social, economic, and demographic storylines. ICLUS outputs are derived from a pair of models. A demographic model generates county-level population estimates that are distributed by a spatial allocation model (SERGoM v3) as housing density across the landscape. Land-use outputs were developed for the four main SRES storylines and a baseline (""base case""). The model is run for the conterminous USA and output is available for each scenario by decade to 2100. In addition to housing density at a 1 hectare spatial resolution, this project also generated estimates of impervious surface at a resolution of 1 square kilometer.",{4D34EB4D-FDD9-4612-98DE-3C723B6B0095},public

They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005).

EPA,http://water.epa.gov/type/rsl/monitoring/streamsurvey/index.cfm,National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS) N/P Values for Streams - Wadeable Streams Assessment,"The National Aquatic Resource Survey (NARS) findings for nutrients in streams and lakes highlight that nutrient pollution is widespread across the United States and impacts biological communities. The NARS analysis examined the range of values for nutrients in least-disturbed sites in a WSA region [WSA regions are modified Level III ecoregions from Omernik (1987)] and used this distribution for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to separate sites into those having high, medium, or low concentrations of nutrients. Sites identified as ""high"" were worse (i.e., had higher nutrient concentrations) than 95% of the sites used to define least-disturbed condition. Similarly, the 75th percentile of the least-disturbed distribution was used to distinguish between sites in medium and low condition. This means that sites reported as being as ""low"" were as good as or better than 75% of the sites used to define least-disturbed condition. A relative risk analysis of the data from this survey found that nationally streams and lakes have more than two times greater risk of having degraded biological communities when nutrient concentrations are high than when they are low. / For more information, please consult the National Wadeable Streams Assessment (WSA) Report available online at: http://water.epa.gov/type/rsl/monitoring/streamsurvey/index.cfm:",{2B8D2CC3-4A57-4B9B-9882-EA5B7C12A5D6},public

EPA,ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/us/us_eco_l3.zip,Level III Ecoregions of the Conterminous United States,"Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989). / Literature cited: / Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997, Ecological regions of North America- toward a common perspective: Montreal, Commission for Environmental Cooperation, 71 p. / Gallant, A.

The NHDPlus includes a stream network (based on the 1:100,000-scale NHD), improved networking, naming, and ""value-added attributes"" (VAA's). NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainageenforcement technique first broadly applied in New England, and thus dubbed ""The New-England Method"". This technique involves ""burning-in"" the 1:100,000-scale NHD and when available building ""walls"" using the national WatershedBoundary Dataset (WBD). The resulting modified digital elevation model(HydroDEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree with the NHDand WBD. An interdisciplinary team from the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and contractors, over the lasttwo years has found this method to produce the best quality NHD catchments using an automated process.The VAAs include greatly enhanced capabilities for upstream and downstream navigation, analysis and modeling. Examples include: retrieve all flowlines (predominantly confluence-to-confluence stream segments) and catchments upstream of a given flowline using queries rather than by slower flowline-by flowline navigation; retrieve flowlines by stream order; subset a stream level path sorted in hydrologic order for stream profile mapping, analysis and plotting; and, calculate cumulative catchment attributes using streamlined VAA hydrologic sequencing routing attributes.The VAAs include results from the use of these cumulative routing techniques, including cumulative drainage areas, precipitation, temperature, and land cover distributions. Several of these cumulative attributes are used to estimate mean annual flow and velocity as part of the VAAs.NHDPlus contains a snapshot (2005) of the 1:100,000-scale NHD that has been extensively improved. While these updates will eventually make their way back to the central NHD repository at USGS, this will not have happened prior to distribution of NHDPlus because the update process for the central NHD repository is still in development. Consequently, the NHDPlus will contain some temporary database keys and, as a result, NHDPlus users may not make updates to the NHD portions of NHDPlus with the intent of sending these updates back to the USGS. Once the NHDPlus updates have been posted to the central NHD repository, a fresh copy of the improved data can be downloaded from the central NHD repository and that copy will be usable for data maintenance. Note that the NHDPlus products are tightly integrated and user modifications to the underlying NHD can compromise this synchronization.",{C0627CEF-D34E-4C14-813F-85D68DEB6BE3},public

NHDPlus provides a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water quality related entities, such as fish advisories locations. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network in a manner similar to street addresses. The assignment of reach addresses is accomplished through a process known as reach indexing. Fish consumption advisories and fish tissue sampling stations are reported to EPA by the states. Sampling stations are the locations where a state has collected fish tissue data for use in advisory determinations. Fish consumption advisory locations are coded onto NHDPlus flowline features to create point and linear events.

This ensures that all Americans have the same basic health and environmental protections. The law allows individual states to have stronger pollution controls, but states are not allowed to have weaker pollution controls than those set for the whole country. EPA calls these pollutants ""criteria air pollutants"" because the agency has regulated them by first developing health-based criteria (science-based guidelines) as the basis for setting permissible levels. One set of limits (primary standard) protects health; another set of limits (secondary standard) is intended to prevent environmental and property damage.

Disposal categories illustrated on the map include: åá Underground Injection Class I wells (Section 5.4.1). Disposal in Class I wells includes the emplacement of hazardous and nonhazardous fluids (industrial and municipal wastes) into isolated formations beneath the lowermost underground source of drinking water (USDW). Because they may inject hazardous waste, Class I wells are the most strictly regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and are further regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). åá Disposal in Underground Injection Class II-V Wells (Section 5.4.2). The subsurface emplacement of fluids through wells. TRI chemicals associated with manufacturing, the petroleum industry, mining, commercial and service industries, and federal and municipal government-related activities may be injected into Class I, II, III, IV or V wells, if they do not endanger underground sources of drinking water (USDW), public health or the environment. Disposal in Class I wells (see above) are reported separately from disposal in Class II-V wells. o Class II wells are used for injection of brines and other fluids associated with oil and gas production. o Class III wells are used for injection of fluids associated with solution mining of minerals. o Class IV wells are used for injection of hazardous or radioactive wastes into or above a USDW and is banned unless authorized under ground water remediation laws. o Class V wells inject nonhazardous fluids into or above a USDW and are typically shallow, onsite disposal systems, such as floor and sink drains which discharge directly or indirectly to ground water, dry wells, leach fields and similar types of drainage wells. Beginning with the 1996 reporting year, facilities report amounts injected into Class I wells separately from amounts injected into all other wells (Class II-V). This change was made to reflect the difference in management standards and regulatory oversight provided by the Underground Injection Control Program for Class I wells as distinguished from other forms of injection reportable to TRI. åá RCRA Subtitle C Landfills (Section 5.5.1A). Disposal in RCRA Subtitle C landfills in which wastes are buried. These are landfills that are subject to stringent requirements for liners, leak detection systems and groundwater monitoring. åá Other Landfills (Section 5.5.1B). Disposal of toxic chemicals in landfills other than RCRA Subtitle C landfills. Beginning with the 1996 reporting year, facilities report amounts disposed of in RCRA Subtitle C landfills separately from amounts disposed of in other on-site landfills. This change was made to recognize the difference in management and regulatory oversight provided for RCRA Subtitle C landfills. åá Land Treatment/Application Farming (Section 5.5.2). Management techniques in which a waste containing a listed chemical is applied to or incorporated into soil. åá RCRA Subtitle C Surface Impoundments (Section 5.5.3A). The total amount of the EPCRA Section 313 chemical that was placed in and remained in (did not volatilize from the impoundment during the reporting year) the RCRA Subtitle C surface impoundments. A surface impoundment is a holding area used to volatilize and/or settle waste materials. Examples of surface impoundments include holding, settling, storage and elevation pits; ponds and lagoons. åá Other Surface Impoundments (Section 5.5.3B). The total amount of the EPCRA Section 313 chemical that was placed in surface impoundments other than RCRA Subtitle C surface impoundments. Beginning with the 2003 reporting year, facilities report amounts disposed of in RCRA Subtitle C surface impoundments separately from amounts disposed of in other on-site surface impoundments.

What is a total maximum daily load (TMDL)? Water quality standards are set by States, Territories, and Tribes. They identify the uses for each waterbody, for example, drinking water supply, contact recreation (swimming), and aquatic life support (fishing), and the scientific criteria to support that use. A TMDL is the sum of the allowable loads of a single pollutant from all contributing point and nonpoint sources.

Sites identified as ""high"" were worse (i.e., had higher nutrient concentrations) than 95% of the sites used to define least-disturbed condition. Similarly, the 75th percentile of the least-disturbed distribution was used to distinguish between sites in medium and low condition. This means that sites reported as being as ""low"" were as good as or better than 75% of the sites used to define least-disturbed condition.

They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions (n = 968) are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called ""criteria"" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA sets limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the air anywhere in the United States. This ensures that all Americans have the same basic health and environmental protections. The law allows individual states to have stronger pollution controls, but states are not allowed to have weaker pollution controls than those set for the whole country. EPA calls these pollutants ""criteria air pollutants"" because the agency has regulated them by first developing health-based criteria (science-based guidelines) as the basis for setting permissible levels. One set of limits (primary standard) protects health; another set of limits (secondary standard) is intended to prevent environmental and property damage.

[EPA.R2_ESA_Grant_Condition_bnd]","In the early to mid 1980s, the Environmental Protection Agency, Region 2, funded a number of sewage treatment infrastructure projects. In order to comply with Executive Order 11988, ""Floodplain Management,"" and Executive Order 11900, ""Protection of Wetlands,"" it was determined that EPA would have to ensure that these Federally-funded projects would not lead to degradation or loss of ""Environmentally Sensitive Areas"" (ESAs) (generally wetlands and/or floodplains) due to increased development pressures brought about by the provision of sewage treatment facilities. In order to fund these projects, EPA had to prepare Environmental Assessments (EAs), and make a finding based on the EA that the individual project in question would not have a significant impact on the environment. For projects where it was believed that provision of the Federally-funded sewage treatment infrastructure could lead to impacts to ESAs, a grant condition was utilized, requiring that the connection of any new construction located on a parcel in which ESAs were present that was located within the service area of the Federally-funded infrastructure project receive written approval by the Regional Administrator of Region 2 before being allowed to connect to the Federally-funded sewage treatment infrastructure in question.

The TEAP divides nineteen individual measures into three main layers: diversity, rarity, and sustainability. This feature class represents the composite of these three layers. The results from the diversity, rarity, and sustainability layers are summed to create the composite grid with scores potentially ranging from 3 to 300. The higher scores represent areas that may be of a higher ecological importance. / TERS was established in July 2002 to seek greater Federal and State interagency collaboration on identifying and supporting joint priorities, particularly regarding transportation issues. Leaders from participating agencies (see Supplemental Information) jointly identified common interests and target activities for collaborative ecosystem management, thereby benefitting each agency. Common interests and uses included identification of highest priority natural resources areas (wetland, aquatic, terrestrial) for avoidance, mitigation, or potential compensation or restoration; ""streamlining"" of regulatory processes; early assistance with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) planning; and analysis of cumulative impacts. TERS participants also identified uses for the TERS ecological assessment within each agency's mission. The vision, as developed by the TERS executives, included the following actions: Improve mutual understanding; Use collective knowledge to support decisions-making; and Strive for synergism. The TERS approach to achieving this vision was to use an ecosystem approach to organize strategies that achieve effective and measurable environmental results, and jointly communicate the results to the public. The initial goals of TERS were to identify high priority ecological areas, potential mitigation areas, and streamline the regulatory processes. The TEAP is part of the first goal: the ecological assessment and identification of priority ecological resources in the state of Texas.

There are also a number of other federal agencies engaged in projects with Tribal, State, and local officials, and community stakeholders. Like many western river ecosystems, the Middle Rio Grande faces numerous challenges in balancing competing needs within a finite water supply and other resource constrains. Historical practices by our ancestors and immigrants to the Middle Rio Grande have established the conditions that we have inherited. Long-term drought exacerbated by climate change is changing conditions that affect natural and human communities as we strive to improve our precious Rio Grande.The Middle Rio Grande/Albuquerque Urban Waters Federal Partnership will reconnect our urban communities, particularly those that are overburdened or economically distressed, with the waterway by improving coordination among federal agencies and collaborating with community-led revitalization efforts. Our projects will improve our community water systems and promote their economic, environmental and social benefits. Specifically, the Middle Rio Grande/Albuquerque Urban Waters Federal Partnership will support the development of the Valle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge, the first urban refuge in the Southwest, as well as numerous restoration projects along the Middle Rio Grande/Albuquerque, a pilot watershed-based storm water management program, a climate change project, and transportation and economic development initiatives in the South Valley.Users can discover more about the project on the partnerships website, http://www.urbanwaters.gov/mid-riogrande/index.html.The portion of the partnership data provided by the Bureau of Reclamation in support of the project is based in significant part on data compiled in support the mapping exercise for the DOI Secretary•À_•À_•À_?•À_•À_?•À_s 2012 Middle Rio Grande Conservation Initiative Report http://middleriogrande.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=zWjw3lgpeyE%3d&tabid=488&mid=1401&forcedownload=true> The data compiled for this report was ultimately presented in the Appendix as maps and tabular data and ultimately no metadata was produced other than at the attribute level. The original data•À_•À_•À_?•À_•À_?•À_s scope was identified as applicable in support of the Urban Waters Partnership since the partnership seeks to advance the work of the America•À_•À_•À_?•À_•À_?•À_s Great Outdoors Initiative http://www.doi.gov/americasgreatoutdoors/index.cfm>, of which the 2012 MRG Conservation Initiative was a part of. This data represents an updated and revised dataset of similar scope with additions identifying Conservation, Education, and Recreation opportunities within the Middle Rio Grande region from Cochiti Reservoir through Elephant Butte Reservoir and as such depicts features from a more broad geographic area of interest than the Urban Waters Partnership.Originally, maintenance and restoration work was included in the point feature class of the MRG Conservation Initiative and classified as a Conservation activity; however, many of the restoration activities are better represented by a polyline feature class. The dynamic nature of the expected deployment of this data allowed for the better representation of each activity as either a point or a polyline. Subsequently, the maintenance and restoration activities have been removed from the comparible layer in the Urban Waters dataset, UrbanWaters_POIs_Points and devided into two feature classes as appropriate, MRG_Activities_line and MRG_Activities_multipoint. Unlike the Urban Waters POIs feature classes in which features share overalap in representation between point and polygon coverages, these to maintenance and restoration activity feature classes are mutually exclusive.The MRG Conservation Initiative dataset was compiled by the Technical Services Division of the Albuquerque Area Office of the Bureau of Reclamation from multiple sources. Because of the congestive nature of the static maps published in the 2012 report, several lesser projects were ommitted in 2012. The dataset for the Urban Waters Program however, while not depicting any new activities from either 2013 or 2014, has been expanded to depict all identified activities from 2002 to 2012. Many maintenance and restoration activities coincide with previous activities also resident in this dataset, therfore portions of or wholly coincident geometries may identify multiple featues discernable only through interogating the data with the identify tool.The source geometry for this feature class is a derivative of the National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) Flowline feature class. Along much of the Rio Grande, this feature class is classified as an artificial path, i.e., a geometric network path used for directed flow analysis. Often these artificial paths do not accurately represent the geometry of the river because they are covered by a polygon for cartographic purposes. In any case, the NHD is out of date, especially over dynamic features like rivers such as the Rio Grande which change annually and indeed with every precipitation or release event. Therefore, the source geometry will not reflect the ground truth alignment of the Rio Grand at larger scales. All locations are approximate and in no case does the geometry reflect or is intended to reflect the actual maintenance and restoration activities.",{C24E9DCF-A112-4873-BB80-5A7AACA8CEDF},public
