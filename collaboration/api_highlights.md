## Government API Milestones and Great Examples

* **BroadbandMap.gov** - The team behind [BroadbandMap.gov](http://www.broadbandmap.gov) adopted a true API-first model - beginning by building out [a powerful suite of APIs](http://www.broadbandmap.gov/developer) and *then* building the website on top of their own APIs.  This is the model for all projects to adopt.  
* **Department of Labor** - The Department of Labor maintains [a single, integrated API program department-wide](developer.dol.gov).  By offering a clean, consistent endpoint to developers, Labor is able to then also provide more robust set of developer resources - including SDKs, code samples, FAQ, api key generation, and feedback forums.  
* **Federal Register** - In addition to offering [a reliable API to a fundamental dataset](https://www.federalregister.gov/blog/learn/developers), the Federal Register also makes a point to consume the [Regulations.gov API](http://www.regulations.gov/#!developers) in FederalRegister.gov, [creating a mashup](https://www.federalregister.gov/blog/2012/04/in-synch-with-regulations-gov) that provides a better user experience.  
* **Census Bureau** - The Census Bureau's [API program](http://www.census.gov/developers/) is notable for its solid incorporation of best practices.  The team took the time to design a clean, comprehensive API that addressed real user needs, while still offering bulk data, a developer mailing list, ease of registration, and an app gallery.  Furthermore, they continue to iterate and grow the available data calls based on analytics and [real user feedback](http://apiforum.ideascale.com/).  
* **[USASearch API](http://search.digitalgov.gov/developer/index.html)**
* **[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](cfpb.github.io/api/hmda/)**
* **[Department of Health and Human Services](http://healthdata.gov/developer)**
