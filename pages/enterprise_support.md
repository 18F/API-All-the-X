In addition to the Training and Direct Support options available to any federal agency gratis, 18F now also offers a paid tier of API support that bundles a comprehensive package of deliverables to help agencies build a complete API program.  The program provides agencies with hands-on training, direct support, and the delivery of the major components that make up an API program.  We can work with your tech team to stand up a healthy first generation API program in months, not years.  For agencies with existing efforts, the program strengthens and scales out the role of APIs within the agency, making them more robust and comprehensive.   

The Enterprise Agency Support package is available on demand and is managed via Inter-Agency Agreement.  The program provides three months of engagement.
