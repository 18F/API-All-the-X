For each project; [tracked here](https://github.com/18F/API-All-the-X/issues/180).  

### Is the team engaging with an agency?  

* Gray should offer a brief on the status of API efforts at the agency and offer any points of contact.  
* Gray should contact the team if he has an interaction with the agency.  
* Gray should ask the team whether the production of an API can be a part of the project.   
* Gray should ask the team generally plug APIs to the agency and make sure the agency is aware of /Developer Program support options (training, direct support, api.data.gov).   

### Is the team engaging with an agency's API team?  

* Gray should ask the team if find any APIs that aren't listed in the /Developer Program status tracker.  
* Gray should ask the team to recommend the US Government APIs listserve to anyone they come across who is working on or curious about APIs.
