1. Purpose:  The purpose of this primer is to familiarize Federal acquisition officials with Application Programming Interfaces (API) and to provide relevant background information for consideration in the formation of contractual agreements with commercial providers and other government agencies.  

2. What is an API?  “An Application Programming Interface, or API, is a set of software instructions and standards that allows machine to machine communication—like when a website uses a widget to share a link on Twitter or Facebook.” (Source: HowTo.gov)~

3. Why are API’s important?  API’s standardize the transactions of understandable groupings of information between machines, thus increasing the speed and dependability of communications between those machines.  Increased speed and reliability increase efficiency and lower costs.  Additionally, the standardization of transactions creates economies where the amount of reuse is great. The effective purchase, use and maintenance of API’s will allow the Government to “Buy once, use many times” to quote an OMB mantra.

4. When should API’s be part of a requirement?  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) through the White House’s Digital Government Strategy has established API’s as a “new default” tool for opening government content and data effectively, efficiently, and accessibly to agencies and citizens. There are a large number of scenarios where Agencies should include API’s as part of their requirements.  Here are some common examples seen across Government:  
 * Any contract where the objective is to share or report information,
 * Any contract where machines need to communicate with one another and share transactional information,
 * A system development contract where API’s are part of the larger system,
 * A software maintenance contract where access to an API must be maintained,
 * A general services IT contract where the production and maintenance of APIs is part of the overall requirements of an agency,
 * A Statement of Objectives for a services vendor which requires qualifying vendors to provide an API for the Agency’s uses,
 * An existing IT contract that provides developer resources capable of producing APIs,
 * A modification to an existing contract that has been used to build and maintain a specific system which now must add a requirement for the contractor build an API for the system.

5.	Where are API requirements usually located in a contract?  Requirements for API’s are usually located in the Statement of Work, Statement of Objectives, Performance Work Statement or whatever document is used to express Agency requirements to the vendor community.Including API’s as requirements will increase information sharing and promote the Digital Government Strategy.

6.	Though API's are useful in many ways, the questions, what services enabled are, and to whom the services are available to, need to be carefully considered. Poorly designed and poorly structured services offer minimal benefit and may compel vendor lock in. Poorly targeted user audience and authentication mechanisms can result in overload, under usage and unnecessary complexity in maintenance, and security weaknesses.
