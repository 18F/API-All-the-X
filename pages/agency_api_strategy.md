title: "Template API Strategy (Under Construction)"
---

  
## Summary  

Across the Internet and throughout each sector of business, the central role of APIs in the digital revolution cannot be overstated.  This document details a path for [AGENCY]’s adoption and integration of APIs.  

## Background 

[Add in policy directives driving APIs]

## Goals  

### Short   

* Create a foundation on which to build, technologically and with people 
* Begin acculturating internally 
* Prompt initial external interest
   * Begin developing an external developer community 
* *Get Started*

### Long 
* Private sector efficiencies
* Faster prototyping 
* Greater ease of prototyping 
* Lower cost of development 

## Benefits

Providing information and services through Web APIs supports interoperability and openness. Well-designed APIs make data freely available for use within agencies, between agencies, in the private sector, or by citizens.

APIs:

* Increase the reach of your services by allowing other agencies, partners, and the private sector to integrate—and amplify—your agency’s data and content.
* Save time through automation. You can update data or content once, and your API can refresh in multiple locations automatically on a website, mobile platforms, and on social media venues.
* Save costs by allowing third-party innovators to use information and services to create new, useful products that are beyond the scope—or budget—of your agency.
* Speed product development through improved prototyping and ease of access for internal teams and sister agencies by allowing granular and open access to content.
* Build markets by improving access to government resources like health, economic, energy, education, environmental resources for entrepreneurs to build upon.
