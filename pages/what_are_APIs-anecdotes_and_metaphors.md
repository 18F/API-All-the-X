## Background

It can be hard to tell someone what APIs are.  Here's a running list of analogies, metaphors, and other efforts at trying to convey in one or two sentences what APIs are.  


## Ideas

* APIs return a webpage except for machines.  
* APIs are like the engine of a car.  You don't have to know how it works but rather just turn the key in the ignition and it handles everything underneath.  
* APIs are like fabric woven together from different sources to make something new.  
* APIs are like a bartender.  It's what you interact with to get information (what beers do you have on tap?) and functionality (serving you a beer).
* APIs are like magic.  
* APIs are like a contract or a promise.  
* APIs are the things that you want others to be able to do with your stuff.  
* APIs are like prayers - you ask for things through them.  
* APIs are like the world's best retriever.  You say, 'Fido - go fetch me X' and he brings you back X.  
* APIs are like Siri.
* APIs are how programs and web services talk to each other.  
* APIs are like what's in between a car's ignition and engine.  I don't know how it works but I know that if I turn the keys in the ignition, the engine will turn on.  
* UIs are how people use computers.  APIs are how computers use computers.  
* It allows different groups to interoperate without having to interoperate.
* When you add an API to a system, the change is similar to moving from CDs to all digital music files.
