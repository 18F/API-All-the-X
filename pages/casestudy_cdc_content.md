title: "CDC Content Services API - Case Study"
---

## Summary

As our society becomes more mobile, it is increasingly important that we, as content providers, find efficient ways to manage information across web sites, social media, and mobile apps. We must also find ways to free our content from the constraints of a particular display, be it mobile phone, tablet, desktop, or something in between. With CDC’s Content Services API, we can house information in one place, and simultaneously distribute it and update it across multiple channels and platforms. 

## Challenge

Many CDC partners, particularly state and local health departments, rely on CDC to provide content that is then integrated into their web sites, including outbreak information, immunization recommendations, food safety warnings, the latest on emergency preparedness, and features on healthy living. Until CDC’s Content Services API was available, these partners had to cut-and-paste content from CDC’s site into their own, and were then burdened with the responsibility of monitoring the source information, and keeping track of updates. 

## Approach

Taking a cue from established news syndication networks such as the Associated Press and National Public Radio’s model of digital syndication, CDC set out to create a content syndication engine to alleviate pressure on state and local sites dependent on up-to-date CDC content.  CDC first released the Content Services API and storefront in 2007, and has continued to make incremental improvements in functionality, including with the most recent release, a content rating system and the capability for users to comment. Users are encouraged to register and are then provided with a unique ID that facilitates the collection of metrics. Registered users can use the site to generate customized syndication code and maintain an inventory of pages they have syndicated. There is also an internal administration site for managing syndicated content as it appears in the storefront, and giving internal staff the ability to manage their own collections. 

## Results 

To date, CDC has over 850 registered syndication partners in all 50 states and in 17 countries. There are approximately 9,000 CDC content pages available for syndication, with more added every day, and this content appears on over 5,200 partner pages. Syndication accounts for an additional 126,000 page views of CDC content per month, or approximately 1.5 million page views per year. 

## Lessons Learned

Some of the lessons learned along the way are:

* State and local health departments are hungry for content they can use in conjunction with their own local web sites. They are extremely pleased to have content that is updated at the source, and minimally maintained on their side of the syndication relationship.
* Secondary audiences such as Federal agencies, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations and commercial entities including hospitals have been equally enthusiastic about using CDC content on their web sites and applications.
* Content of all types is sought, including short snippets of information and longer more dense pages.  
* Marketing efforts should include both internal audiences and external partners; technical staff as well as health communicators.
* Not every user registers. Some savvy users can generate their own code, bypassing our metrics collection process.
* Frequent incremental updates to the system are preferred to major overhauls. 

## Next Steps

CDC is actively collaborating with other federal agencies and states to more broadly implement Content Services and develop it into an open content and multimedia sharing platform that will include not only HTML content, but video, images, feeds, and data. Our goals are to facilitate the sharing of credible, science-based information, reduce development and maintenance costs of digital assets for ourselves and our partners, and positively impact the health of our nation by reaching people where they are.  Key partners in this collaboration include HHS’s Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products, NIH’s National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Cancer Institute, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
