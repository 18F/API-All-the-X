What this is for?  

### Design Requirements

* RESTful
* JSON
* Use [API.Data.gov](http://api.data.gov/about) 
* Create an endpoint that can scale to all future agency use (e.g. https://api.agency.gov/data/name_of_this_api).  
* Allow key-less access to the API so developers can quickly begin looking at the returns

### Documentation Requirements
* HTML - No Word documents or PDFs
* Interactive Documentation

### Process Requirements
* Include a beta testing phase
* Conduct an [API Usability session](http://18f.github.io/API-Usability-Testing/) during the pre-production phase
* Allow bulk download of the underlying dataset
* Create a public repository in the agency's GitHub account that will be used for managing the project, including:
   * Project Roadmap
   * Issue Tracker used by staff for development of the API as well as for bug-reporting and other engagement with external users.  
   * Changelog
* In the design phase, publish the api design as well as draft documentation in this GitHub repository and ask for public feedback.  
* Allow bulk download of the underlying dataset


### Other Requirements
* Ensure clear, informative errors 
* Obey http rules 
* Don't make up custom terms and variables
