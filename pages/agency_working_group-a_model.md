title: "Agency Working Group - A Model"
---

## Outline

* **Lead(s)** - One or more individuals who are coordinating the API planning and implementation activity of the agency.  They ensure that the agency is actively focused on current and future API decisions and tasks.  

* **Representatives** - A wide range of stakeholders should be represented on the API working group.  Each operating division of the agency should have a point of contact and each major system should be represented.  Larger divisions and systems may well need multiple representatives.  On the other hand, one person may sometimes represent more than one smaller division or system, but what is important is that important that each division and system be sufficiently represented.  

* **Operational Partners** - It's imperative that any API working group include some level of involvement with the legal, IT, IT security, and public affairs operations for the agency.  

* **Buy-In** - The working group should also make a point to target the principal interest groups of the agency, to ensure that the central interests of the agency's major external stakeholders are woven into the interests of those who most often interact with the agency.  

## Operational Model

An API working group should regularly meet, to ensure that the agency's conversation around APIs moves forward at a continuous pace.    
  
It's also important to have a regular collaboration mechanism available for the working group, such as a listserve or internal chat room.  

## Potential Activities
* Recruit API points of contact from unrepresented 
* Brainstorm how agency API programs can consolidate shared resources
