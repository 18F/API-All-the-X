When producing an API, one of the most important compontents is solid API documentation.  One very productive decision can be to copy and re-purpose another's API documetation - filling in your specifics but otherwise taking advantage of good work others have already done.  To facilitate this, we have created a vanilla version of CFPB's [high quality HMDA API documentation](http://cfpb.github.io/api/hmda/).  Any agency can take the template linked below and use it to quickly deploy solid, user-friendly documnetation.   

* [Developer Hub Template](http://usg-website-templates.github.io/developer-hub/) - *[[code](https://github.com/USG-Website-Templates/developer-hub)]*
* [Case Study of GSA's Re-Use of CFPB's Open Source API Documentation](http://18f.github.io/open-source-program/pages/case_study/CFPB_open_source_documentation)

## Other Examples of Open Source API Documentation

The following API documentation is hosted in GitHub and can be easily re-purposed by other agencies.  

* [CFPB's HMDA API](http://cfpb.github.io/api/hmda/)
* [GSA's SAM API](http://gsa.github.io/sam_api/sam/)
* [GSA's DigitalGov Search APIs](http://search.digitalgov.gov/developer/)
* [FDA's APIs](https://open.fda.gov/)
* [DOL's APIs](http://usdepartmentoflabor.github.io/DOLAPI/)
