## Background
This document attempts to provide a description of an agency API program at different stages of development.  This can assist an agency in determining its current state and to clarify a vision for further progress.  

## Maturity Model

### Governance

**Governance:**
"How well the API lifecycle is governed in terms of:   
* Responsibility and ownership   
* Effectiveness measurement and metrics  
* Enterprise policies and guidance  
* Compliance and control mechanisms  
* Formal communication channels"    
  
**Requirements Management:**	  
Extent to which requirements for Mobile APIs are clearly articulated and managed  
**Quality Assurance/ V&V / Compliance/Audit:**	  
Extent to which policies, requirements, standards and processes are reviewed and enforced  
**Product Management:**	  
Extent to which the longer term evolution of Mobile APIs are being formally managed so they continue to support mission/business goals and support consumer needs  
**Developer Engagement:**	  
Extent to which an organization actively engages the developer community in defining and using Mobile APIs

| **Sharing of APIs**                           | Mobile APIs are poorly documented and no effort is made to share them or make them discoverable                                                | Mobile APIs are well-documented but are shared in ad hoc ways (eg sending Word document when requested)                                                    | Enterprise establishes a policy or procedure for publishing Mobile APIs along with establishing a web site or registry that is browseable                                 | Mobile APIs are documented, shared and discoverable and are maintained under a change/configuration management                                                                                                    |
