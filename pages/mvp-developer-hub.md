In the cases where a team wants to jumpstart a developer hub but doesn't have APIs to highlight, here's a good way to still launch a minimum viable product that is a good start that can be iterated on.  

1) Create a page at `[agency].gov/developer`.  
2) Set up a redirect to it at `[agency].gov/developers`.  
3) Lead off with a short, friendly, honest welcome, along these lines:  

````
Welcome to the [Agency] Developer Hub!  We'll be adding new datasets, APIs, and code here and asking how we can better support developers who want to build on top of these resources.  We're just getting started and there's a lot to do so please sign up for updates and let us know how we can help.   
````

4) Have some worthwhile actions, preferably including at least:   
  * Sign up for updates (links to a developer news mailing list)   
  * Tell us what APIs you would find useful (links to a public forum where you've asked this question and where they can respond, such as a GitHub issue tracker, a blogpost where you ask the question and tell people to answer in the comments, or even just a tweet where you ask it)  
  
5) Add links to the following (if they exist) either in the sidebar or as bullet points in the body of the page:   
  * [Agency] Data Hub (links to agency data hub), or  
  * [Agency] on Data.gov (links to the agency's section of data.gov)   
  * [Agency] on GitHub (links to the agency's GitHub account)  
  * Developer News (links to a 'developer' tag on the agency blog, to a page that links to curated, relevant blogposts, or just some links directly to a few developer-centric blogposts).    
  * [Department or Sub-Agency] Developer Hub (links to developer hubs of a higher level department or lower level sub-agency or program, if they exist)  
  

  Note - The above is a solid and worthwhile start that an agency can begin with, even before they have any APIs.  But it must then be an effort that the agency continues.  If you have a developer updates mailing list, you need to do things worth updating those who sign up for it.  If you ask what APIs the agency should release, you need to release APIs.  This MVP model isn't a substitute for a developer program, but rather a good start that can get the ball rolling.
