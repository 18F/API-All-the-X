*[Under Construction]*

**Q)**  Is it legal for a federal agency to offer public APIs?

**A)**  *Yes.  An API is basically an extension of the agency's website.  Visitors may visit it and retrieve information.  In fact, recent guidance from the Office of Management and Budget have encouraged agencies to publish APIs.*    

**Q)**  Would API key registration trigger the Paperwork Reduction Act? 

**A)** *No - there are exceptions to PRA, including for 'subscriptions'.  Developers are subscribing to data with an API key, similarly to someone subscribing to a newsletter.*  

**Q)** Is it required that federal agencies offer a developer terms of service?  

**A)** *No.  Developer terms of service exist to clarify the relationship between the agency and developers.*  

**Q)**  Do federal agencies increase liability by offering read APIs?  

**A)** *No - the same risks exist with the publication of the agency's website.*
