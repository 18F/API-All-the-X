### Scenario B
*Agency uses the below text as the scope of work for a task within a larger system creation/maintenance contract.  This task could be included from the start or added as a modification to the contract.*  

The scope of work for this task includes the following activities:

* Design and develop the Application Program Interface (API) for [Name of System].
* Develop a widget that leverages the output of the API.
* Develop analytics capability to track API usage.
* Test API output.
* Create visual presentation of API output.
* Demo API functionality to stakeholders.
* Develop a section for the developers page within the [agency]’s website that promotes the API, along with supporting documentation for utilizing the API, including the following:
 * Overview.
 * Description and Lists of Query Fields.
 * Sample queries with explanations.
 * Examples of usage.

### Scenario C
*Agency includes the below text as part of its requirements for a contract, in order to ensure the API access to a specific system or dataset that the contractor is tasked to maintain.*  

The Contractor shall provide the technical capability that creates access to the data sources listed in task [##] via one or more APIs (Application Program Interface), web services solution (i.e., a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network), or other relevant or useful Internet protocol (e.g., HTTP). Batch downloading of data source may [optional: ‘should’] be available but may not be the sole access; real-time, machine-readable access must be provided for all core data sources.

Where applicable and available, core platform infrastructure and capabilities may be provided through third-party services or providers. Such providers must meet specific contractual requirements for availability, reliability, and all Government requirements for security, terms of services, privacy, 508 compliance, etc.

### Scenario D
*Agency includes the below text as part of a general services IT contract, ensuring that the production and maintenance of APIs is part of the overall capabilities that the agency acquires.*  

The Contractor shall provide a complete information platform solution for purposes of supporting defined, directly-supported systems; increased use of information via open data and Web 2.0 strategies; and to support all activities in this SOW.  The tasks to be performed include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Provide the content ownership and maintenance of databases and information sources core to program services and operations.
* Provide an Internet-based public platform for the use and sharing of content, information, and data, through the use of APIs (Application Program Interface) and open data formats.
* Provide, through maintenance, development, and operational support, the availability of the [program] website, and underlying systems and information technology that supports all program tasks and activities.
* Develop platform capabilities, web and Internet-based information sites, and services using the core sources and APIs.

### Scenario E
*Agency includes the below language in the Statement of Objectives for a services vendor procurement in order to require qualifying vendors to provide an API for the agency’s uses.*  


Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs)

* [System] shall allow additional information to be added/collected via an API or webform or both.
* Data collected in web forms can be easily and automatically submitted to the [system]
* [System] shall provide API access to [system] data so additional applications can be built and easily connected to the [system] database.

### Scenario F
*Agency already has a general services IT contract in place that provides developer resources capable of producing APIs.*
Further guidance to the contractor includes:

* The contractor shall provide online user documentation detailing the minimum requirements for correctly using the Web API.  The documentation shall minimally contain examples showing the correct syntax of API requests and their corresponding responses.
* The contractor shall ensure that contact information for users seeking technical support is prominently displayed in the online Web API documentation.
* The contractor shall develop a strategy for maintaining Web API versions over the life-cycle of the task order.  [optional] The contractor shall provide online, user-facing documentation that clearly distinguishes differences in usage between the current version of the Web API and its previous versions.
* The contractor shall provide quarterly reports that list the number of times the Web API has been used.

### Scenario G
*Agency includes the following text in its requirements listing for a general IT services contract, so as to have resources available for any agency API production or consumption needs.* 

The work will be planned and implemented in design and development of specific projects and enhancements, per planned releases and projects:

* Design, develop and maintain Java, JSP, Java Servlets, XML, Web Services against  datasets in relational and flat databases.
* Design, develop and maintain Service-Oriented Architecture applications.
* Implement, test, and assist in the deployment of APIs.
* Document any APIs so that the information may be published in the developer resource’s section of the [agency] website and [agency] GitHub account.
* Perform knowledge transfer with [agency] personnel on how the API was implemented (via code review, etc.).
* Contribute to best practices developer guidelines for agency APIs.
* Test and integrate newly developed Java applications and web services.

### Scenario H
*Agency modifies an existing contract which has been used to build and maintain a specific system, using the below text to add a requirement that the contractor build an API for the system.*  

The goal of this addendum to incorporate an Optional Services task in Section [##] of the SOW, Software Engineering – Web Development to design, develop, test, document, and deploy an API (application programming interface) for the [Name of System]. Due to restrictions with the Government hosting facility, this API should be developed using the [XX] programming language. Additionally, the Government will provide an XML-formatted version of the content to be made accessible via the API as well as the current codebase used to create the [Name of System].

Specifically, this modification will require the following tasks to be performed:


* Assist in the definition of requirements for the API.
* Implement, test, and assist in the deployment of the API.
* Document the API so that the information may be published in the developer resource’s section of [agency].gov (http://www.[agency].gov/develolper).
* Perform knowledge transfer with [agency] personnel on how the API was implemented (via code review, etc...).
* Contribute to best practices developer guidelines for APIs.
* Identify opportunities to contribute code created for [agency] initiatives to open source projects, showing leadership in open government and technology.
