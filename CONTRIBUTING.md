Thanks for contributing! There are two ways:
 - The Prose.io model (more for content contributions)
 - The defacto fork-and-pull model (content *and* technical contributions)


#### The Prose.io model

1. Navigate to [http://www.prose.io](http://prose.io/#18f/API-All-the-X)
2. _Authorize_ prose.io to access your GitHub account.  
3. Navigate to [http://prose.io/#18f/API-All-the-X](http://prose.io/#18f/API-All-the-X)
3. Make edits and click the floppy disk icon
    - A dialog will appear to describe the changes and to _submit a change request_
    - This _should_ do two things: 
      1. Fork the repository to your account and ..
      1. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)


#### The fork-and-pull model:

1. Fork this repository to your personal account.
2. Create a branch and make your changes.
3. Test the changes locally/in your personal fork.
4. Submit a pull request to open a discussion about your proposed changes.
5. We'll talk about it and decide to merge or request additional changes.
