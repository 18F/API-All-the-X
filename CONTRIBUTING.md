Thanks for contributing! There are two ways to submit changes:
 - The Prose.io model (easiest when you're just making text changes)
 - The fork-and-pull model (for content *and* technical contributions)


#### The Prose.io model

1. Navigate to [http://www.prose.io](http://prose.io).
2. _Authorize_ prose.io to access your GitHub account.
3. Navigate to [http://prose.io/#18F/API-All-the-X/tree/gh-pages/pages](http://prose.io/#18F/API-All-the-X/tree/gh-pages/pages).
4. Click on the page you would like to edit. For example, if you want to make a change to the "benefits_of_apis" page on the site (http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/benefits_of_apis), you would click on "benefits_of_apis.md".
5. Make your edits, then click the floppy disk icon when you're done.
    - A dialog will appear to describe the changes and to _submit a change request_.
6. Describe your changes, then click the "Submit Change Request" button.
    - This _should_ do two things:
      1. Fork the repository to your account
      2. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
7. We'll review your pull request and merge it if your changes are acceptable. Otherwise, we'll request additional changes from you.


#### The fork-and-pull model:

1. Fork this repository to your personal account.
2. [Run the site on your computer](https://github.com/18F/API-All-the-X#running-the-site-locally-on-your-computer).
3. Create a branch and make your changes.
4. Test the changes locally/in your personal fork.
5. Submit a pull request to open a discussion about your proposed changes.
6. We'll review your pull request and merge it if your changes are acceptable. Otherwise, we'll request additional changes from you.
