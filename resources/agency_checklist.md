  * Do each of your APIs [have an html homepage](http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government/api-release-kit) that provides access to all relevant resources for the APIs?
  * If your agency has not yet made an API, get started [by building your first](http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government/how-to-make-apis-overview).
* Have you [created a developer hub](http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government/get-started-with-apis#implement)?
  * Do the URLs agency.gov/developer, agency.gov/developers, and agency.gov/api each [direct visitors to this hub](http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government/api-developer-kit)?
  * Does the hub provide [a path to the homepages for each of your agency's APIs](http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government/api-developer-kit)? 
  * Does the hub convey to visitors that they can expect to find your agency's future APIs linked from this hub as well?

  * If you [employ API keys](http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government/api-release-kit#api-key-management), have you ensured that the developer can receive a key on demand and without delay?
* For your agency's developer hub:
  * Have you unified the [Terms of Service](http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government/api-developer-kit#terms-of-service) for your APIs?
  * Have you made available an [FAQ section](http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government/api-release-kit#faq) along with a means for the public to request new questions?
  * Have you made available an [apps gallery](http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government/api-developer-kit#apps-gallery) to showcase mashups and applications that utilize your APIs?
  * Have you made available a [status dashboard](http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government/api-developer-kit#status-dashboard) for your APIs?
* Have you created a public data hub?

* Have you reviewed your agency's most popular data and services for consideration as your next APIs?
* Have you reached out to projects currently in development in order to request that they integrate API production into their requirements?
 
## Advanced

* Have you enabled an API for your website content?
* Have you developed an API-first strategy for upcoming projects?
* Have you developed a plan for systematically API-enabling your current systems and data?
* Have you assembled relevant stakeholders to collaborate on normalizing API documentation and design? 
* If you have multiple API key solutions, have you set about normalizing them?
