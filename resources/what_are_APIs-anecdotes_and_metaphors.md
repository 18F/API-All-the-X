## Background

It can be hard to tell someone what APIs are.  Here's a running list of analogies, metaphors, and other efforts at trying to convey in one or two sentences what APIs are.  


## Ideas

* APIs return a webpage except for machines.  
* APIs are like the engine of a car.  You don't have to know how it works but rather just turn the key in the ignition and it handles everything underneath.  
* APIs are like fabric woven together from different sources to make something new.
