Thanks for contributing! There are two ways:
 - The Prose.io model (more for content contributions)
 - The defacto fork-and-pull model (content *and* technical contributions)


#### The Prose.io model

1. Browse the live site, http://if.io/open-source-program-template/
2. At any point, click the "Edit this page in prose.io" link in the left-hand navigation
    - This will drop you into prose.io
    - You will need _authorize_ prose.io to access your GitHub account. There should be a link in the lower right-hand
      corner of the prose page for this purpose.
3. Make edits and click the floppy disk icon
    - A dialog will appear to describe the changes and to _submit a change request_
    - This _should_ do two things: 
      1. Fork the repository to your account and ..
      1. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)


#### The fork-and-pull model:

1. Fork this repository to your personal account.
2. Create a branch and make your changes.
3. Test the changes locally/in your personal fork.
4. Submit a pull request to open a discussion about your proposed changes.
5. We'll talk about it and decide to merge or request additional changes.
